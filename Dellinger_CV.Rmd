  - Applied a critical ecology framework to examine how structural racism and classism (resource allocation, residential segregation, and wage differentials) drive air pollution disparities and impact biogeochemical cycles. 
  - Synthesized and managed large-scale ecological and social datasets in R, integrating atmospheric chemistry, economics, and historical policy impacts into a broader Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) framework..  

## **Graduate Student Researcher**  
California State University, Northridge (September 2021   - September 2024) 

   
  - Designed and executed controlled mesocosm experiments to investigate the interactive effects of ocean acidification and warming on the physiological energetics of the intertidal gastropod *Tegula funebralis*, utilizing thermal performance curves to assess energetic expenditure under future climate scenarios.
  - Maintained high-precision seawater conditions across 16 experimental tanks by regulating carbonate chemistry (pH, total alkalinity, pCO₂) and temperature, while simulating natural intertidal dynamics using solenoid valve-driven tidal fluctuations.
  - Conducted routine water chemistry monitoring, including total alkalinity, pH, and carbonate system calculations, using potentiometric pH measurements and titrations (Dickson protocols) with certified reference materials.
  - Applied advanced statistical modeling in R, employing nonlinear regression, two-way ANOVAs, and thermal performance curve analysis to quantify temperature-dependent metabolic responses.  

## **NSF Research Traineeship (Sustainable Oceans)**
